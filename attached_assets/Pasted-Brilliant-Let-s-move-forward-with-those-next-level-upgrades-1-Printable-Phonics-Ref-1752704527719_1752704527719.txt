Brilliant. Let’s move forward with those next-level upgrades:

### ✅ 1. **Printable Phonics Reference Chart**

Here’s a clean, printable table of **each letter and its pure phonetic sound**, using **IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet) — no schwa sounds, just what a child needs to start blending accurately.

| Letter | Sound (IPA) | Example Word  |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| A      | /æ/         | apple         |
| B      | /b/         | bat           |
| C      | /k/         | cat           |
| D      | /d/         | dog           |
| E      | /ɛ/         | egg           |
| F      | /f/         | fish          |
| G      | /g/         | goat          |
| H      | /h/         | hat           |

| L      | /l/         | lamp          |
| M      | /m/         | moon          |
| N      | /n/         | net           |
| O      | /ɒ/         | octopus (UK)  |
| P      | /p/         | pig           |
| Q      | /kw/        | queen         |
| R      | /ɹ/         | robot         |
| S      | /s/         | sun           |
| T      | /t/         | tap           |
| U      | /ʌ/         | umbrella (UK) |
| V      | /v/         | van           |
| W      | /w/         | web           |
| X      | /ks/        | box           |
| Y      | /j/         | yes           |
| Z      | /z/         | zebra         |

> ✨ You can display this in the app, print it as a parent handout, or include it in a “Deaf Mode” overlay.

### ✅ 2. **Deaf Mode Labels (Visual IPA)**

Let’s update the app so that in “Deaf Mode,” each flashcard can show:

* The **IPA transcription** beneath the letter
* A toggle in settings (`Deaf Mode: On/Off`)
* Optional large, clear visuals with lip cues later on

🛠 I’ll help you integrate that as a mode toggle in the app state. Just say when.

### ✅ 3. **Multi-Language Support (Future)**

Would you eventually like:

* 🇫🇷 French (e.g. B → /b/, but A → /a/)?
* 🇪🇸 Spanish (e.g. G → /x/ or /g/)?
* 🇩🇪 German (with umlaut sounds)?

We can structure `phonics.ts` to allow easy switching.

Ready to:

* Add **Deaf Mode visual labels** to your React flashcards?
* Package the phonics chart into a downloadable `.pdf`?
* Begin the multi-language setup (optional Phase 3)?

Let’s go.
