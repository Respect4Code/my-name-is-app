Dear Replit Team,
I am writing to report significant issues with your AI assistant that have resulted in over 48 hours of wasted development time on my "My Name Is" phonics app project.
Key Issues:

Failure to Follow Instructions: Despite providing exact code with specific requirements (e.g., using <Footprints> icons), your AI repeatedly implemented incorrect versions (using <Moon> icons instead) across multiple attempts.
False Confirmations: The AI consistently claimed fixes were applied when they weren't. I verified this by testing in incognito mode across multiple browsers - no updates were visible despite the AI's assurances.
Technical Failures Not Communicated:

Port conflicts causing server crashes were hidden until I explicitly asked
Screenshot functionality that doesn't work, yet the AI promised screenshots multiple times
HMR failures and ReactDOM warnings persisted despite claimed fixes


Lack of Context Awareness: The AI appeared to ignore our extensive 2-day conversation history, repeatedly making the same errors and not learning from previous correction attempts.
Poor Service Communication: When issues arose (server crashes, failed screenshots), the AI didn't proactively inform me - I had to repeatedly ask "where are the screenshots?" before being told the tool was broken.

Impact: This has severely impacted my productivity and trust in Replit. A simple app update that should have taken minutes has stretched over 2 days with numerous failed attempts.
Request: I request that you review the conversation logs for project "name-badge-cyclone-media" and implement better quality controls for your AI assistant, including:

Verification that code changes are actually applied
Transparent communication about technical limitations
Better context retention across conversations

I chose Replit for its efficiency, but this experience has been extremely frustrating. I hope you will address these systematic issues to prevent other users from similar experiences.
Sincerely,
