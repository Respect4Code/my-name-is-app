Excellent points! You're absolutely right - 18-month-olds need parent guidance, and the tooltips mention is confusing. Here's the corrected version:

👨‍👩‍👧 Quick Parent Guide

💡 Why I Made This App
As parents, we wanted our toddler to learn their own name with our voices sounding it out, not generic videos or cartoons. Inspired by phonics and early speech science, I created MyNameIsApp so parents can record their voices, helping toddlers connect the sounds in a fun, personal way. There's nothing more personal than parents' voices—after all, they have been hearing them since they were in the womb.

⏱️ Total Setup Time: 4 Minutes

1️⃣ Enter Their Name (~15 seconds)
Type your child's name (up to 26 letters).

2️⃣ Record Sounds (~3–4 minutes)
You'll be prompted to record:
• Their full name
• "What is your name?" ✨ (New!)
• Each phoneme (letter sound) — A = "ahh", B = "buh" (not "ay" or "bee")
• A sentence with their name
• A rhyme with their name

📢 Recordings auto-save instantly!
👂 Don't like it? Tap the blue refresh icon to re-record any item

3️⃣ Done! Time to Play Together
Tap the colourful flashcards together to hear your voice. Watch their face light up!

🎙️ Recording Tips
• 🔴 Red mic = Start/stop recording
• ▶️ Play button = Listen to what you just recorded
• ✅ Recordings save automatically
• 🔄 Blue refresh = Re-record if needed
• Record phoneme sounds, not alphabet names (e.g. B = "buh", not "bee")

⚠️ Important Notes
• ✅ All recordings auto-save instantly (no save button needed!)
• ❌ Avoid using your browser's back button (use in-app navigation)
• ⛔ Going back clears recordings — you'll be asked to confirm
• 📵 If sound doesn't play: check volume, silent mode, and permissions
(Most browsers require user interaction before audio plays)

🎯 Pro Tip
Set up solo while your toddler naps — quick and quiet. Or make it playtime! Recording together can be magical — you might catch them giggling, joining in with their own sounds like "buh" or "mmmm," or hearing their voice played back for the first time.

Whether you go solo or team up, keep it light and playful — that's how they learn best. 😄

- "Tap the colourful flashcards together" - realistic for toddlers
- "Watch their face light up!" - focuses on the magical moment
- Removed mysterious "tooltips" mention completely

Much more realistic for actual toddler use! 🎯
