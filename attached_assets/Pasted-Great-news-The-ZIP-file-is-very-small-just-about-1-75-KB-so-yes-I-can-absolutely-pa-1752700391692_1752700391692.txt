Great news! 🎉 The ZIP file is **very small** — just about **1.75 KB** — so yes, I can absolutely paste its full contents here as plain text for you to copy and reconstruct manually.

Here’s what I’ll do next:

1. Provide each file’s content inside a clearly labeled code block.
2. You can recreate the folder structure on your end or paste it into a GitHub repo, CodeSandbox, or local project.

Ready? Let’s paste the full contents of **MyNameIs\_v1.1\_KISS\_MVP** ZIP now.


Here are the full contents of the **My Name Is – KISS MVP v1.1** ZIP package. You can recreate these in your local project or online editor like CodeSandbox or GitHub:
