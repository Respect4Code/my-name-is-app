Looking at your deployment saga, I can see the core issue. Here's exactly what to tell Replit to fix this once and for all:

# ðŸš¨ URGENT: DEPLOYMENT FIX FOR "MY NAME IS" APP

## THE PROBLEM
The app works perfectly in development but fails on deployment at https://name-badge-cyclone-media.replit.app

## THE ROOT CAUSE
Your deployment is configured for **Static Deployment** but your app has an **Express server**. This is a fundamental mismatch.

## THE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Switch to AUTOSCALE Deployment (Recommended)
Your app has a Node.js/Express server (`server/index.ts`), so it needs **Autoscale** deployment, not Static.

**Steps:**
1. Cancel current Static deployment
2. Choose **Autoscale** deployment instead
3. Settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`
   - No "public directory" setting (Autoscale doesn't use this)

### Option 2: Remove the Server (Make it truly static)
If you want to keep Static deployment, remove all server code:
1. Delete `server/` directory
2. Update `package.json` scripts:
   ```json
   "build": "vite build",
   "preview": "vite preview"
   ```
3. Update `vite.config.ts`:
   ```javascript
   build: {
     outDir: "dist",
     emptyOutDir: true
   }
   ```
4. Deploy with:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Public directory: `dist`

## WHY THIS IS HAPPENING

Your app structure shows:
- `server/index.ts` - Express server
- `server/vite.ts` - Server-side Vite handling
- Production expects: `npm start` â†’ `node dist/index.js`

**This is NOT a static app!** It's a full-stack app with:
- Express server handling routing
- Server-side static file serving
- Production build creating both server and client code

## IMMEDIATE FIX

**Tell Replit:**
1. "This app has an Express server, it needs Autoscale deployment, not Static"
2. "Please switch my deployment type to Autoscale"
3. "Keep build command as `npm run build` and start command as `npm start`"

## TEST CONFIRMATION

The deployment works when:
1. https://name-badge-cyclone-media.replit.app loads
2. You see "My Name Is" welcome screen
3. You can enter a name and see flashcards
4. Parent recording feature works

---

**BOTTOM LINE: You need AUTOSCALE deployment because you have a server. Static deployment will never work with your current architecture.**

**Please switch to Autoscale deployment immediately to resolve this issue.**
