Totally fair. “VIP mode” was originally a marketing crutch: flip a switch to reassure *very* privacy-sensitive parents by turning off anything that *looked* networky and by showing a big “max privacy” banner. In practice, your app already has the strong default: **no upload, no account, no persistence**. So VIP adds confusion without real benefit.

### What I recommend

**Drop VIP entirely** and make privacy the default, loudly communicated in-line.

#### Replace VIP with a tiny, universal badge

Show a one-liner under the mode title everywhere:

> **🔒 Privacy:** Audio stays on this device. Nothing is saved or uploaded.

(You already do this technically; this just makes it obvious.)

## Tiny patches to remove VIP

1. **Types / state**

```ts
// before
type Mode = 'standard' | 'alphabet' | 'numbers' | 'actions' | 'grandparent' | 'vip';
// after
type Mode = 'standard' | 'alphabet' | 'numbers' | 'actions' | 'grandparent';
```

2. **Secret menu + banners + messages**

* Remove all `'vip'` entries from:

  * the secret menu list
  * the mode banner `getModeStyle()`/colors
  * the `messages` map in `setMode`
  * any placeholder text branches

3. **Magic words**

```ts
// remove the VIP branch:
else if (value === 'VIP') { setMode('vip'); setName(''); }
```

4. **Cleanup**

* Delete any `currentMode === 'vip'` JSX blocks.
* If you had special VIP behaviors (hiding share links, etc.), make those **default** or drop them.

## Optional (nice touch, still zero data)

* Add a **“Wipe Session”** link next to “Start Over” that just calls your existing revoke/reset routine. Copy: *“Erase all in-memory clips now.”*
* Keep the small per-word **Play** button; no bulk “Play All” (we already removed it).

This keeps the product simpler, aligns with your promise, and avoids labeling parents as “paranoid.” If later you want something extra, we could add a **Kiosk Lock** (disables external links + requires a 4-digit pin to exit) for nurseries/classrooms—still local-only and not a new “mode.”
