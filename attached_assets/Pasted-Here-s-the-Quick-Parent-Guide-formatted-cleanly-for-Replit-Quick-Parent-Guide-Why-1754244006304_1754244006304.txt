👨‍👩‍👧 Quick Parent Guide

💡 Why I Made This App
As parents, we wanted our toddler to learn their own name with our voices sounding it out, not generic videos or cartoons. Inspired by phonics and early speech science, I created MyNameIsApp so parents can record their voices, helping toddlers connect the sounds in a fun, personal way. There's nothing more personal than parents' voices—after all, they have been hearing them since they were in the womb.

⏱️ Total Setup Time: 4 Minutes

1️⃣ Enter Their Name (~15 seconds)
Type your child's name (up to 26 letters).

2️⃣ Record Sounds (~3–4 minutes)
You'll be prompted to record:
• Their full name
• "What is your name?" ✨ (New!)
• Each phoneme (letter sound) — A = "ahh", B = "buh" (not "ay" or "bee")
• A sentence with their name
• A rhyme with their name

📢 To re-record: Tap the blue refresh icon beside any item
👂 Preview: Listen before saving to ensure it's perfect

3️⃣ Done! Let Them Play
Your child taps colourful flashcards to hear your voice. That's the magic.

🎙️ Recording Tips
• 🔴 Red mic = Start/stop recording
• ▶️ Play button = Preview your voice
• ✅ Green check = Save
• 🔄 Blue refresh = Re-record
• Record phoneme sounds, not alphabet names (e.g. B = "buh", not "bee")
• 🧠 Check the on-screen tooltips for help!

⚠️ Important Notes
• ✅ All recordings are auto-saved
• ❌ Avoid using your browser's back button (use in-app navigation)
• ⛔ Going back clears recordings — you'll be asked to confirm
• 📵 If sound doesn't play: check volume, silent mode, and permissions
(Most browsers require user interaction before audio plays)

🎯 Pro Tip
Set up solo while your toddler naps — quick and quiet. Or make it playtime! Recording together can be magical — you might catch them giggling, joining in with their own sounds like "buh" or "mmmm," or hearing their voice played back for the first time.

Whether you go solo or team up, keep it light and playful — that's how they learn best. 😄
