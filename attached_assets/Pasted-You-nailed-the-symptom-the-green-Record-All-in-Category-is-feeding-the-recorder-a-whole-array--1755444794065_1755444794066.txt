You nailed the symptom: **the green ‚ÄúRecord All in Category‚Äù is feeding the recorder a whole array (or a joined string) instead of stepping word-by-word.**
The fix is just to add a queue + index and render **only the current word**, advancing the index when you tap ‚úì.

Here‚Äôs a tiny, surgical patch you can drop into your current `WelcomeScreen`:

---

### 1) Add queue + index state

```ts
// near other useState lines
const [ingQueue, setIngQueue] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [ingIndex, setIngIndex] = useState(0);
```

### 2) Select one word vs. the whole category

```ts
// tap a single chip
const chooseWord = (word: string) => {
  setIngQueue([word.toLowerCase()]);
  setIngIndex(0);
  setIngView('record');
};

// tap the green button
const chooseAllInCategory = () => {
  if (!ingCategory) return;
  setIngQueue([...ING[ingCategory]]);   // <-- array of words
  setIngIndex(0);
  setIngView('record');                 // start with the first word
};
```

(If you show the green button before a category is picked, add `disabled={!ingCategory}` to it.)

### 3) Render the recorder for the **current** word only

```tsx
{ingView === 'record' && ingQueue.length > 0 && (
  <RecordWord
    key={ingQueue[ingIndex]}                 // force fresh UI per word
    word={ingQueue[ingIndex]}                // <-- a single string
    index={ingIndex + 1}
    total={ingQueue.length}
    onNext={() => {
      const next = ingIndex + 1;
      if (next < ingQueue.length) {
        setIngIndex(next);                   // advance to next word
      } else {
        setIngView('words');                 // finished this category
        setIngQueue([]);
        setIngIndex(0);
        showToastNotification('‚úÖ All words recorded!');
      }
    }}
    onBack={() => setIngView('words')}
  />
)}
```

### 4) Make sure the recorder expects a **string**, not an array

```ts
// RecordWord props should be:
type Props = { word: string; index: number; total: number; onNext: () => void; onBack: () => void };
```

In its header show progress:

```tsx
<h2>Record: {word} ({index}/{total})</h2>
```

Hook buttons to actions:

* ‚ñ∂Ô∏è start/stop your MediaRecorder
* ‚úÖ calls `onNext()` (advance to next word)
* üîÑ clears the current take and lets you re-record

And add a small unmount guard so the mic isn‚Äôt left open:

```ts
useEffect(() => () => { if (rec?.state === 'recording') rec.stop(); }, [rec]);
```

---

### Why this fixes your screenshots

* ‚Äú**Record: eating drinking brushing‚Ä¶**‚Äù happened because the recorder was receiving the **whole list** (array or joined string). Now it always receives **one word**: `ingQueue[ingIndex]`.
* The green button now truly means **step through every word** in that category with `(n/total)` progress.
* The pink ‚ÄúRecord Typed Word‚Äù keeps working independently.

If you want, I can also show a one-liner to split multiple typed words (‚Äúclapping, waving‚Äù) into a queue, but the change above is enough to make **Record All in Category** behave exactly as intended.
