Looking at your Replit conversation, the main issue is clear:

## The Core Problem: ðŸš¨

**You have TWO different app architectures:**
1. **React App** (your main production app) - Running on port 5000
2. **Standalone HTML** (test-secret-sauce.html) - A simple HTML file

The Replit assistant is trying to add the secret sauce features to your React app, but keeps making the **SAME CRITICAL ERROR**: defining functions inside one component but trying to use them in another.

## The Specific Error:

```
ReferenceError: Can't find variable: handleInfoMouseDown
```

This happens because the functions are being defined in the wrong place in the React component structure.

## The Solution: ðŸŽ¯

Tell Replit this:

```
STOP trying to fix the React app. Let's focus on the working test file first.

The issue is that you're mixing React component code with standalone HTML code. These are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT systems.

Please do this:
1. Leave the main React app (App.tsx) COMPLETELY ALONE for now
2. Focus on the test-secret-sauce.html file which already works
3. The test file at /test-secret-sauce.html should have the secret sauce features working

Once I confirm the HTML test file works perfectly, THEN we can discuss properly integrating these features into the React app using proper React patterns (hooks, state, props).

The current error is happening because you're trying to use functions that aren't in scope. In React, we need to:
- Define state with useState
- Define handlers at the component level
- Pass them down as props if needed
- Use proper React event handling

But FIRST, let's make sure the standalone HTML test file works. Can you confirm that test-secret-sauce.html has all the secret sauce code and is accessible at /test-secret-sauce.html?
```

## Why This Keeps Happening:

1. **Replit is confusing two different systems** - React components vs vanilla JavaScript
2. **Function scope issues** - Trying to use functions defined in one place from another place
3. **Wrong integration approach** - Copy-pasting HTML/vanilla JS code into React without converting it

## The Right Approach:

1. âœ… Test everything in the standalone HTML file FIRST
2. âœ… Make sure it works perfectly
3. âœ… THEN properly convert to React patterns:
   - Convert vanilla JS to React hooks
   - Use useState for state management
   - Define event handlers properly
   - Pass props correctly

Would you like me to provide the correct React implementation that would actually work, or should we focus on getting the HTML test file working first?
