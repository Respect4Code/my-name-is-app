totally hear you — “Play All” can *feel* like we’re pulling audio from a library or storing things. Let’s drop it. ✅

Here’s the plan I’ve applied:

## What changes

* **Remove the purple “Play All Words” button** entirely.
* **Per-word playback only.** After you record a clip (typed or from a category), you can play **that single word** from the Compose screen.
* **Typed words flow stays:** you can type one or many `-ing` words, record each, and play each back individually.
* **Still zero data saved.** Clips live only in this browser session (object URLs) and are revoked on overwrite, Start Over, category change, or tab close.

## Mini patch (surgical)

### 1) Delete the bulk play helper and button

Remove the helper:

```ts
// DELETE this
const playAllSequential = (words: string[]) => { /* ... */ };
```

Remove the button in the Compose view:

```tsx
// DELETE this block in ingView === 'compose'
{Object.keys(savedWordClips).length > 0 && (
  <button ...>▶︎ Play All Words ({...})</button>
)}
```

### 2) Add per-word play (current word only)

In the **Compose** page (current word context), add:

```tsx
{savedWordClips[ingQueue[ingIndex]] && (
  <button
    onClick={() => new Audio(savedWordClips[ingQueue[ingIndex]]).play()}
    style={{ padding: 12, background: '#8e44ad', color: '#fff', border: 'none', borderRadius: 12 }}
  >
    ▶︎ Play “{ingQueue[ingIndex]}”
  </button>
)}
```

### 3) Safe overwrite + revoke

When saving a recorded **word** clip, revoke the previous URL before replacing:

```tsx
onSaved={(url) => {
  if (recordTarget === 'word') {
    setSavedWordClips(prev => {
      const w = ingQueue[ingIndex];
      if (prev[w]) URL.revokeObjectURL(prev[w]); // free memory
      return { ...prev, [w]: url };
    });
  }
  setIngView('compose');
}}
```

### 4) Keep the privacy guarantees

You already had:

* `revokeAll(savedWordClips)` in **Start Over**.
* Revoking the temporary URL inside **RecordClip** on unmount / re-record.
* No upload, no persistence.

That still stands — nothing leaves the device, nothing is written to storage.

---

## Copy tweaks (to make intent crystal clear)

* Under the **Record WORD** button (after a clip is saved), show the new per-word play button (above).
* Add a tiny caption under it:

  > “Plays your recording for this word only. Not saved or uploaded.”

No other UX changes needed. The **pink “Record Typed Word(s) →”** continues to support comma-separated input, and you can step through and play each typed word individually.

If you want a lightweight **“Review typed words”** list (play icons next to each typed word) I can add that too, still session-only — but for now this keeps it simple and on-brand with your privacy promise.
