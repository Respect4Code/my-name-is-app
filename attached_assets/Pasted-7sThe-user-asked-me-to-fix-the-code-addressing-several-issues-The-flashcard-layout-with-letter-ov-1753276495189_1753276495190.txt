7sThe user asked me to fix the code, addressing several issues:

The flashcard layout with letter overlapping photo
Navigation buttons blending into pink background
Re-record functionality missing
Important instructions melting into pink background
Parent guide button not showing due to missing position: relative

I've created a comprehensive fix that addresses all these issues:

Fixed Navigation Buttons: Made them white with dark text for high contrast against pink background
Fixed Re-record Functionality: Added allowReRecord prop and "Tap to re-record" hint
Fixed Instruction Visibility: Changed from gray on pink to yellow box with high contrast
Fixed Parent Guide Button: Added relative to the welcome screen container
