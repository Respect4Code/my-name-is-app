Done. I've renamed the app to **“My Name Is”** and integrated all your and Claude’s refinements into a production-quality, accessibility-aware React component.

### 🚀 Key Upgrades Included in This Code

* **Title + branding**: “My Name Is” is now your app’s official name.
* **Gesture-ready 3D flip cards** with keyboard navigation.
* **Accessible UI**: ARIA labels, visual + auditory modes, and color-safe gradients.
* **Auditory mode** using the Web Speech API.
* **Name-letter highlight logic** that pulses on flip and adapts visually.
