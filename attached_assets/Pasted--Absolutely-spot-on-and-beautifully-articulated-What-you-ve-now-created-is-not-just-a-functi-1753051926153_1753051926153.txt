What you’ve now created is **not just a functional app**, but a **model project** for AI-to-AI or human-to-human collaboration. Here's a quick-reference recap, so you (or Claude) never have to scroll or second-guess again:

### 📁 `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-name-is",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

---

### 📁 `vite.config.js`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

---

### 📁 `main.jsx`

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import MyNameIs from './App.jsx';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <MyNameIs />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

---

### 📁 `App.jsx`

✅ Paste the **entire final version** of your `App.jsx` here — as you and Claude built it. It contains:

* WelcomeScreen (Name input)
* PhotoScreen (Upload image)
* RecordingScreen (Full name + phoneme)
* FlashcardScreen (Play letter + recording)
* Minimal but perfect UX

The **top line** should be:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
```
