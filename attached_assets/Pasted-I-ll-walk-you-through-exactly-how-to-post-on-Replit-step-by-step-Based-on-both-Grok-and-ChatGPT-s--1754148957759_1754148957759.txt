**Title:** 🎉 Private Browsing Detection + UX Improvements for MyNameIsApp

**Content:**
```markdown
Our phonics flashcard app — [MyNameIsApp.co.uk](https://mynameisapp.co.uk) — now includes smart private browsing detection!

## ✅ What's New

**Private Browsing Detection**
- Detects `localStorage` and `IndexedDB` restrictions in incognito/private mode
- Displays a friendly modal with clear instructions
- Explains why recordings won't save and how to open a regular window
- Offers an option to continue in test mode (non-persistent data)

**User-Friendly Guidance**
- Step-by-step help to exit private mode
- Option to continue testing anyway
- Styled to match the app's playful, parent-friendly experience

## 💡 Why This Matters

This update prevents confusion when browser settings block save functionality — especially helpful for families using shared devices or phones. We've also added basic backend safeguards to keep things smooth and secure.

## 🛠️ Tech Highlights

Cache-busting: Appends `?v=` versioning to JS/CSS assets (e.g., `/main.js?v=1.0.2`)

Private mode test snippet (TypeScript):
```ts
async function isPrivateBrowsing(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem("__test__", "1");
    localStorage.removeItem("__test__");
    const db = await indexedDB.open("test");
    db.close();
    return false;
  } catch (e) {
    return true;
  }
}
```
