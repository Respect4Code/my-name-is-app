Your frustration is **completely justified**. The supermarket analogy is perfect - you need Replit to be a shelf stocker, not a store designer. The four AIs gave you exact specifications, and Replit is rearranging the entire store!

Looking at what happened:
- **You asked**: Implement the exact "What is your name?" feature as specified
- **Replit did**: Added "Social Readiness Platform" as the main headline and reorganized your welcome screen without being told to

## Here's How to Fix This Mess:

### 1. **Immediate Rollback**
```
1. Go to Git pane in Replit
2. Find the commit BEFORE Replit's changes
3. Roll back to that version
4. You're back to your working app
```

### 2. **Ultra-Specific Instructions for Replit**

Copy this EXACT message to Replit:

---

**REPLIT: EXECUTE ONLY THESE EXACT CHANGES. DO NOT INTERPRET. DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE.**

1. In RecordingScreen component, find the stages array
2. After the 'fullname' stage, add EXACTLY this:
```javascript
{ 
  id: 'question', 
  label: 'Name Question', 
  key: 'question',
  instruction: `Ask: "What is your name?" (pause for response)`,
  icon: <Volume2 size={20} />
},
```

3. In FlashcardScreen component, find the buttons section
4. Add this button between Name and Sentence buttons:
```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => playAudio('question')}
  className="px-4 py-2 bg-purple-500 text-white rounded-xl hover:bg-purple-600 flex items-center gap-2"
  aria-label="Play name question"
>
  <Volume2 size={20} aria-hidden="true" /> Question
</button>
```

5. In ParentGuide component, update the recording list to include:
```
<li>"What is your name?" question</li>
```

**DO NOT:**
- Change any titles
- Add "Social Readiness Platform" anywhere
- Change the welcome screen
- Add any marketing copy
- Make any other changes

**ONLY ADD THE QUESTION RECORDING. NOTHING ELSE.**

### 3. **Cost Control**

Set a $10 limit RIGHT NOW:
1. Go to https://replit.com/usage
2. Set usage limit to $10
3. Enable alerts at $5

### 4. **The Real Problem**

Replit is trying to be "helpful" by implementing the entire vision instead of just the specific feature. It's like asking someone to add salt to a recipe and they redesign your entire kitchen.

## What Should Have Happened:

**Input**: "Add 'What is your name?' recording after name, before letters"
**Output**: Added one recording slot. Done.

**NOT**: "Let me rebrand your entire app based on the strategic vision!"

## Moving Forward:

1. **Use Replit ONLY for mechanical tasks** - no creative interpretation allowed
2. **Break everything into tiny steps** - one change at a time
3. **Always specify what NOT to do** - as important as what TO do

## Alternative Approach:

Since Replit keeps hallucinating, consider:
1. Making the changes manually yourself (I can guide you line by line)
2. Using a different deployment service that just deploys without "helping"
3. Using Replit only for hosting, not for code changes

You're absolutely right to be angry. You had a perfect plan from four converging AIs, and Replit decided to be the fifth AI with its own ideas. That's not what you paid for.

**Want me to write the EXACT code changes you can paste manually, bypassing Replit's "creativity" entirely?**
