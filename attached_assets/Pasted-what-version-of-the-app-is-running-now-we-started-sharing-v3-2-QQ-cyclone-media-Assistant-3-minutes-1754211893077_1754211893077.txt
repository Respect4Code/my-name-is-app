Looking at your current codebase, you're running the React TypeScript version built with Vite and Express. Based on the files I can see, particularly the main src/App.tsx, this appears to be version 2.x of your app.

The current version includes:

Core Features:

Welcome screen with name input
Photo upload with privacy messaging
5-stage recording system (name, letter sounds, walking sentence, singing, rhyme)
Flashcard system with parent voice playback
localStorage persistence
Mobile-responsive design
Current Limitations:

The "What's your name?" question update you mentioned isn't visible in the current App.tsx
This version doesn't have the advanced features from your v3.2 specifications
To confirm what version is actually running and make the "What's your name?" question visible, I'd need to see what specific updates you want applied. The current App.tsx shows a basic welcome screen that asks for the child's name input, but it may not have the enhanced question flow you're referring to.

Would you like me to:

Update the app to show the enhanced "What's your name?" question flow
Check what specific v3.2 features are missing
Apply the latest version updates you've been working on
Which approach would you prefer?
