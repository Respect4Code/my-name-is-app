## EXACT Manual Code Changes - Copy & Paste These Yourself

Here are the precise changes to make manually. No AI interpretation, just pure code placement.

### 1. **RecordingScreen Component - Add Question Stage**

**FIND THIS** in your RecordingScreen component:
```javascript
const stages: Stage[] = [
  { 
    id: 'fullname', 
    label: `Full Name: "${name}"`, 
    key: 'fullname',
    instruction: `Say their name clearly: "${name}"`,
    icon: <Volume2 size={20} />
  },
  ...letters.map((letter, i) => ({
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS** (adds question stage after fullname):
```javascript
const stages: Stage[] = [
  { 
    id: 'fullname', 
    label: `Full Name: "${name}"`, 
    key: 'fullname',
    instruction: `Say their name clearly: "${name}"`,
    icon: <Volume2 size={20} />
  },
  { 
    id: 'question', 
    label: 'Name Question', 
    key: 'question',
    instruction: `Ask: "What is your name?" (pause for response)`,
    icon: <Volume2 size={20} />
  },
  ...letters.map((letter, i) => ({
```

### 2. **FlashcardScreen Component - Add Question Button**

**FIND THIS** in your FlashcardScreen component:
```javascript
        <div className="flex justify-center gap-4 mb-6">
          <button
            onClick={() => playAudio('sentence')}
            className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded-xl hover:bg-green-600 flex items-center gap-2"
            aria-label="Play sentence"
          >
            <Moon size={20} aria-hidden="true" /> Sentence
          </button>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS** (adds question button before sentence):
```javascript
        <div className="flex justify-center gap-4 mb-6">
          <button
            onClick={() => playAudio('question')}
            className="px-4 py-2 bg-purple-500 text-white rounded-xl hover:bg-purple-600 flex items-center gap-2"
            aria-label="Play name question"
          >
            <Volume2 size={20} aria-hidden="true" /> Question
          </button>
          
          <button
            onClick={() => playAudio('sentence')}
            className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded-xl hover:bg-green-600 flex items-center gap-2"
            aria-label="Play sentence"
          >
            <Moon size={20} aria-hidden="true" /> Sentence
          </button>
```

### 3. **ParentGuide Component - Update Recording List**

**FIND THIS** in your ParentGuide component:
```javascript
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-bold">2️⃣ Record Sounds (3-4 minutes)</h4>
              <ul className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-600 list-disc">
                <li>Their full name</li>
                <li>Each letter sound (A = "ahh", B = "buh")</li>
                <li>Sentence with name</li>
                <li>Rhyme with name</li>
              </ul>
```

**REPLACE WITH THIS** (adds question to the list):
```javascript
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-bold">2️⃣ Record Sounds (3-4 minutes)</h4>
              <ul className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-600 list-disc">
                <li>Their full name</li>
                <li>"What is your name?" question</li>
                <li>Each letter sound (A = "ahh", B = "buh")</li>
                <li>Sentence with name</li>
                <li>Rhyme with name</li>
              </ul>
```

## That's It. Nothing More.

**What This Does:**
- Adds one recording slot for "What is your name?"
- Adds one playback button for the question
- Updates the guide to mention the new recording

**What This DOESN'T Do:**
- No title changes
- No "Social Readiness Platform" branding
- No welcome screen modifications
- No marketing copy
- No testimonial prompts
- No SEO changes

**Total lines changed: ~15**

## How to Apply:

1. Open your code editor (not Replit's AI)
2. Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) to find each section
3. Make the replacements exactly as shown
4. Save the file
5. Test locally first
6. Then deploy

## Testing Checklist:

After making these changes:
- [ ] "What is your name?" appears in recording list
- [ ] Can record the question
- [ ] Question button appears in flashcards
- [ ] Question audio plays when button clicked
- [ ] Parent guide shows 5 recordings total

**That's the entire implementation.** No AI interpretation, no creative additions, just the mechanical changes to add one feature. Like putting beans on shelf 2, exactly where you asked.
