# 👨‍👩‍👧 Quick Parent Guide  
*Learn your toddler’s name with YOUR voice!*

---

## 💡 Why I Made This App  
As a parent, I wanted my toddler to learn their own name — using our voices, not some generic cartoon.  
Inspired by phonics and early speech science (and a real train moment in the UK where my 18-month-old said her name), I created *MyNameIsApp* so parents can record their voices and upload real photos.  

After all, your child has been hearing your voice since before they were born — let that be their teacher.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)  

1️⃣ **Enter Their Name (~15 seconds)**  
Type your child’s name (up to 26 letters).  

2️⃣ **Record Sounds (~3–4 minutes)**  
You’ll be prompted to record:  
- Their full name  
- “What is your name?” ✨ *(New!)*  
- Each phoneme (letter sound) — A = “ahh”, B = “buh” *(not “ay” or “bee”)*  
- A sentence using their name  
- A rhyme with their name  

📢 *To re-record*: Tap the blue refresh icon beside any item  
👂 *Preview*: Tap the play button before saving to check sound quality  

3️⃣ **Done! Let them play**  
Your child taps colourful flashcards to hear your voice. That’s the magic.

## 🎙️ Recording Tips  

- 🔴 Red mic = Start/stop recording  
- ▶️ Play button = Preview your voice  
- ✅ Green check = Save  
- 🔄 Blue refresh = Re-record  
- Record **phoneme** sounds, not alphabet names  
  - *(e.g. B = “buh”, not “bee”)*  
- 🧠 Check the on-screen tooltips for help!  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes  

- ✅ All recordings are auto-saved  
- ❌ Avoid using your browser’s back button *(use in-app navigation)*  
- ⛔ Going back clears recordings — you’ll be asked to confirm  
- 📵 If sound doesn’t play: check volume, silent mode, and permissions  
  *(Browsers require user interaction before audio plays)*

## 🎯 Pro Tip  

🎯 Set up solo while your toddler naps — quick and quiet.  
**Or make it playtime!** Recording together can be magical — you might catch them giggling, joining in with their own “buh” or “Debra,” or hearing their voice played back for the first time.  

Whether you do it solo or as a team, keep it light and playful — that’s how they learn best. 😄

### ✅ Where to Put It

* **Option 1 (Markdown Page)**: Add this to `/docs/guide.md` for a clean, shareable Markdown doc

* **Option 3 (Both)**: Show it inside the app **and** link to `/docs/guide.md` for offline reading or sharing

Would you like me to create the styled `QuickStart.tsx` version now too?
