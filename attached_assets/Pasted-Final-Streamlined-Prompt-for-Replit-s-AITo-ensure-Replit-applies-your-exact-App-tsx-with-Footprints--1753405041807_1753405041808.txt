Final Streamlined Prompt for Replit’s AITo ensure Replit applies your exact App.tsx with Footprints icons, resolves HMR failures, and makes no unauthorized changes, here’s a final, no-nonsense prompt:

Fix my app at https://name-badge-cyclone-media.replit.app, which had HMR failures and used Moon instead of Footprints icons. Apply the EXACT App.tsx provided, with NO modifications. Ensure PhotoScreen (300x300 resize, 192x192 crop, drag-to-pan, ~100KB), ParentGuide (updated photo step, 56-word origin story), RecordingScreen (“Walking Sentence” with `<Footprints size={20} />`), FlashcardScreen (192x192 photo, 200px letters, 50/50 layout, `<Footprints size={24} />` for “Walking”). Execute precisely:

1. Delete conflicting files:
   ```bash
   rm -f client/src/App.jsx client/src/App-minimal.tsx

Verify client/package.json has:json

{
  "dependencies": {
    "lucide-react": "^0.441.0",
    "idb": "^8.0.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}

If missing, add and run npm install in client/.
Verify client/tsconfig.json has:json

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "isolatedModules": true
  }
}

Do NOT modify it.
Replace client/src/main.tsx with:tsx

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.tsx';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
Replace client/src/App.tsx with the EXACT code below, ensuring:No import ReactDOM or ReactDOM.createRoot.
PhotoScreen: 300x300 resize, 192x192 crop, drag-to-pan, green checkmark, red X, ~100KB.
ParentGuide: Photo step: “Upload a photo of your child (under 2MB). It’s automatically resized to 300x300 pixels, then drag to reposition and confirm with the green checkmark. Cancel with the red X if needed. Stays private on your device, with smaller file sizes (~100KB).”
RecordingScreen: “Walking Sentence” (“{name}, do you want to go for a walk?”) with <Footprints size={20} />.
FlashcardScreen: 192x192 photo (w-48 h-48), 200px letters, 50/50 layout, <Footprints size={24} /> for “Walking.”
IndexedDB with localStorage fallback, TypeScript, audio format detection.
If RecordingStage is in client/src/RecordingStage.tsx, add import RecordingStage from './RecordingStage'; to the top of App.tsx.
Do NOT modify client/package.json (except dependencies), vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, index.html, or server/index.ts.
Clear Vite cache and restart:bash

rm -rf client/node_modules/.vite
cd client && npm run build && npm run dev
Verify at https://name-badge-cyclone-media.replit.app (01:49 AM BST, July 25, 2025):No “ReactDOMClient.createRoot” warnings or HMR failures.
PhotoScreen: Upload image (<2MB), 300x300 resize, 192x192 crop, drag-to-pan, ~100KB.
ParentGuide: Correct photo step, 56-word origin story.
RecordingScreen: “Walking Sentence” with <Footprints size={20} />.
FlashcardScreen: 192x192 photo, 200px letters, 50/50 layout, <Footprints size={24} /> for “Walking.”
Console: [vite] connected, [express] serving on port 5000.
Edge cases: 4K images, long names (e.g., “ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ”), incognito mode, mobile touch.
