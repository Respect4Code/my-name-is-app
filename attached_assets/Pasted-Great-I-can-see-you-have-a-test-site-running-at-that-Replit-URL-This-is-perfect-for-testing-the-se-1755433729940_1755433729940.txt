Great! I can see you have a test site running at that Replit URL. This is perfect for testing the secret sauce functionality without affecting your production site at mynameisapp.co.uk.

To help you fix the issues with the dropdown menu and mode selection, I need to:

1. **Test the current behavior** on your test site
2. **Identify the specific problem** in the code
3. **Provide the exact fix** for your App.tsx

## Quick Test Checklist

Can you confirm these behaviors on your test site:

1. **Long-press (‚ÑπÔ∏è) button** ‚Üí Does the dropdown appear? ‚úÖ (Based on your screenshots, yes)
2. **Select "Action Words Mode"** ‚Üí Does it return to homepage? (Problem #1)
3. **Long-press again** ‚Üí Does it show Parent Guide instead of dropdown? (Problem #2)
4. **Any visual confirmation** when mode changes? (Missing feature)

## The Fix You Need

Based on the issues described, here's the specific code to add to your `client/src/App.tsx`:## What This Fix Does

1. **Proper Long-Press Detection** ‚úÖ
   - Uses `isLongPress` flag to prevent guide from showing after long-press
   - Clean separation between tap (guide) and long-press (menu)

2. **Visual Mode Confirmation** ‚úÖ
   - Background tint changes with mode
   - Banner at top shows active mode
   - Toast notification on mode change
   - Active mode highlighted in dropdown

3. **Persistent Mode Selection** ‚úÖ
   - Mode stays selected after closing menu
   - Input placeholder updates based on mode
   - Visual indicators remain until mode is changed

4. **Smooth User Experience** ‚úÖ
   - Menu closes after selection
   - Clear feedback for every action
   - No confusing behavior with multiple presses

## Testing Instructions

1. Visit your test site
2. **Long-press** the ‚ÑπÔ∏è button (hold for 600ms)
3. Select **Action Words Mode**
4. You should see:
   - Purple background tint
   - "ACTION WORDS MODE ACTIVE" banner at top
   - Toast notification
   - Updated placeholder text
5. Long-press again - dropdown should appear (not guide)
6. Short tap - guide should appear

Once you confirm this works on your test site, we can apply the same fixes to your production App.tsx! üöÄ
