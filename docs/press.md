# 🗞️ Press Kit – MyNameIsApp

## 🔈 Project Summary

*MyNameIsApp* is the **original Social Readiness & Confidence Platform**, teaching children to say their name using their parent’s own recorded voice — not a stranger’s. It’s 100% private, works offline, and is free under a Creative Commons license.

## 🎬 The Origin Story

> *"On a UK train, a stranger asked my 18-month-old child: ‘What is your name?’ And they answered — clearly and confidently. That moment became this app. I had been using test versions with my child, and it worked."*

Created by a parent who couldn’t find an app that pronounced their child’s name properly, *MyNameIsApp* lets families record and teach name sounds the way **they** say them — from Xochitl to Ayo.

## 💡 What Makes It Different

* ✅ **Parent Voice-Powered**: Every child hears their name in a trusted voice
* 🌍 **100% Name Inclusive**: Works for *every* name in *every* accent
* 🔒 **Privacy First**: No accounts, no tracking, no cloud storage
* 🧠 **Offline & Simple**: Runs in your browser, stores recordings locally
* 💝 **Emotionally Grounded**: Designed around the bond of voice and identity

## 🛠️ Key Features

* 🎤 Record full name + phonemes + rhyme + bedtime sentence
* 🧒 Flashcards display only the letters in your child’s name
* 🧓 Grandparent-friendly UI: large buttons, single tap

## 🧪 Built With

* **React + TypeScript + Vite**
* **TailwindCSS for clarity and accessibility**
* **Web Audio & localStorage only — no server required**
* **Open license: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**

## 🌍 Who It's For

* 👩‍👩‍👧 Parents of toddlers learning their name
* 🌎 ESL families wanting to teach names in English
* 🏡 Homeschoolers looking for inclusive phonics tools
* 🧏‍♂️ Deaf or blind parents who need accessible design
* 🎒 Educators and speech therapists (collaboration welcome)

## 🧠 The Talker Advantage

Studies show children process speech more effectively when it comes from a familiar voice. This is known as the **Talker Advantage** — a phenomenon observed in research from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and others. Children aged 2.5 to 5 understand, retain, and respond to speech better when it’s spoken by a parent or familiar caregiver.

*MyNameIsApp* builds on this advantage — letting families teach name recognition using the voices children already know and love.
