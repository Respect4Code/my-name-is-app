## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Solo vs. Duo Recording**  
  Record alone for quiet clarity. Or include your child for magic moments.

- **Use phoneme clarity**  
  E.g., “/d/” not “dee” for the letter “D.”

- **Keep it playful**  
  Learning works best when they’re having fun.

## 🎧 Why Parent Voice?

Babies recognize your voice from the womb.  
This app helps turn that deep recognition into early speech confidence — especially when asked by a stranger:  
> “What’s your name?”

Your child’s confident reply is the whole mission.
