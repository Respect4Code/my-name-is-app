# 🧬 ORIGIN STORY — MyNameIsApp

## 🚆 A Train. A Name. A Spark.

> On a UK train, a parent asked: *“What is your name?”*  
> Their toddler answered confidently: **“Debra.”**  
> A stranger smiled. A milestone was born.

That moment sparked the idea for **MyNameIsApp** — a privacy-first phonics app that helps children learn their names using their parent’s voice.
