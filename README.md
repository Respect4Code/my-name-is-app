# My Name Is - Personalized Phonics Learning App

Created with ❤️ by **BoredMamaApp**

## 🌟 About This App

As a parent, I noticed that generic phonics apps couldn't handle the unique pronunciations in our diverse world. Names like "Divine" might be pronounced "dih-VINE" or "dee-VINE" depending on the family. 

That's why I built **My Name Is** - the only phonics app where parents record their child's name pronunciation themselves.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Personalized Learning**: Only shows letters in your child's name
- 🎤 **Parent Voice Recording**: YOU record how each letter sounds  
- 🦻 **Inclusive Design**: Visual mode for deaf/hard-of-hearing learners
- 📱 **Works Offline**: Install as an app on any device
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: All recordings stay on your device
- 💝 **Made with Love**: By a parent, for parents

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Enter your child's name
2. Tap each letter to record YOUR pronunciation
3. Let your child practice with flashcards featuring your voice
4. Watch them light up hearing mom or dad's voice!
