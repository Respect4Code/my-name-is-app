## 👨‍👩‍👧 Quick Parent Guide

### 💡 Why I Made This App

We wanted our toddler to learn their name with **our** voices, not from cartoons or strangers. Inspired by phonics and early speech science, *MyNameIsApp* helps toddlers connect sounds to their name in a personal, joyful way.

There’s nothing more powerful than hearing your name spoken with love — and babies have heard their parent’s voices since the womb.
