# 📰 Press & Media Kit – MyNameIsApp

Welcome to the official press and outreach page for **MyNameIsApp**, the world’s first *Social Readiness & Confidence Platform* powered by a parent’s voice.

## 🎬 Origin Story

MyNameIsApp was born from a magical real-life moment:  
> On a UK train, a parent watched their toddler respond to a stranger’s question — *“What is your name?”* — with joy and confidence.  
That spark inspired the creation of a privacy-first tool that helps children learn their names using their family’s voice.
